This project is designed to facilitate the transfer of data from CSV files into a PostgreSQL database using Python. It leverages the powerful libraries Pandas for data manipulation and SQLAlchemy for database interaction.


Overview
In this project, I implemented a Python script that performs the following tasks:


Read CSV Files: Using Pandas, the script reads CSV files located on my MacBook.

Database Connection: It establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.

Data Transformation and Loading: The script processes the data and creates the necessary tables in the database, dumping all the data efficiently.
